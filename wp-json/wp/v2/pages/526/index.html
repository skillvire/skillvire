This service is specially designed for students who have difficulty in researching by themselves &amp; who need constant support along with learnings. With our professional &amp; experienced guidance, you can complete your research work in time with the required standards &amp; expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">We believe in empowering students so, we help, guide, &amp; teach but, not \u2018literally do\u2019 the entire work (the way how the real guide works). Research guidance at SKILLVIRE is optimized as per the type of research we engage in (qualitative or quantitative). We help in domain selection, research type selection, variable selection, sample selection, topic formulation &amp;, methodology formulation. We train the student in the professional technique of literature review. We provide a full document of the research papers having limited access (if needed), tools (if needed), help in calculating the statistics (if needed), &amp; teach how to analyze the qualitative data (if needed). The Student is taught how to frame the results, discussions, &amp; references as well. Once the research is complete, we help the student to prepare a manuscript from their work that can be submitted in a journal with good indexes &amp; high impact factor, later for their research paper publication (we do not provide service of publishing a research paper). Seats for the research guidance services are limited but sufficient. You can take advantage of our free basic-level guidance about how to initiate\/ carry out a research in psychology by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/skillvire\/contact\/\">contacting<\/a>\u00a0us. To apply for the premium guidance service\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/skillvire\/contact\/\">contact<\/a>\u00a0the SKILLVIRE through Email or WhatsApp after which, you will receive a revert back with further details. The charge of premium research guidance for both bachelors &amp; masters students is INR 3500\/- per research. We provide one research with any number of authors per payment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">REFUND POLICY<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Online education: Once registered for an event, payment is only fully refunded if the service is canceled by us or not fully delivered.
