This service is specially designed for students who have difficulty in researching by themselves and who need constant support along with learnings. With our professional and experienced guidance, you can complete your research work in time with the required standards and expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">We believe in empowering students so, we help, guide, and teach but, not \u2018literally do\u2019 the entire work (the way how the real guide works). Research guidance at SKILLVIRE is unique as per the type of research a student proposes. It can be purely qualitative or purely quantitative. We help in domain selection, research type selection, variable selection, sample selection, topic formulation and, methodology formulation. We train the student in the professional technique of literature review. We provide a full document of the research papers having limited access (if needed), tools (if needed), help in calculating the statistics (if needed), and teach how to analyze the qualitative data (if needed). The Student is taught how to frame the results, discussions, and references as well. Once the research is complete, we help the student to prepare a manuscript from their work that can be submitted in a journal with good indexes and high impact factor, later for their research paper publication (we do not provide service of publishing a research paper). Seats for the research guidance services are limited but sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">INTERNSHIP\/TRAINING<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">We believe in helping students to acquire practical skills and real-time work exposure. Interns from psychology, education, and allied disciplines are welcomed to experience and contribute to SKILLVIRE services. We follow the work-from-home model for our organization. The general roles &amp; responsibilities are common for the interns at SKILLVIRE. It includes attending team meetings, calculating quantitative data, collecting data, collecting literature, digital paperwork, research template building, finding tools, helping in services optimization &amp; ideas, outreach, website supervision, external monitoring of the social media handles, etc. Specific roles &amp; responsibilities are assigned based upon the availability &amp; capability of the interns. It includes client handling, service content management, movable-immovable graphics planning, policies &amp; ethical planning, event planning &amp; execution. You can join anytime throughout the year for up to 100 hours at a time, after which you can reapply. An intern can dedicate either morning shift (11 am to 5 pm) or evening shift (5 pm to 10 pm) work from home commitment. This organization does not charge any fee or provide a salary\/ stipend for the internship or training. But, the work experience\/ training letter\/ certificate is chargeable for an intern (covers the letterhead, signature, stamp, and design charges). Experience\/ training letter\/ certificate for up to the first 100 hours is INR 500. For up to every next 100 hours, INR 250 is the charge for the experience\/training letter\/certificate. A single experience letter with more than 100 hours is charged similarly. The second letter is not issued if the dues are not cleared for the first letter. If by any means, an intern presents irresponsible conduct, misbehaves, abuses, causes harm to any team member, becomes a liability to the organization, stops communicating, or does not complete the given tasks, then SKILLVIRE has the authority to end their commitment, deactivate their coupons, and return their dues with a 10% deduction if the strict warning fails to work. If an intern causes damage to SKILLVIRE&#8217;s equipment, it is covered from the intern&#8217;s dues. The experience letter is released after all the pending work is completed and submitted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">REFUND POLICY<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Online education: Once registered for an event, payment is only refunded if the service is canceled by us or not fully delivered.
