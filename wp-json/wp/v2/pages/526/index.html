This service is specially designed for students who have difficulty in researching by themselves and who need constant support along with learnings. With our professional and experienced guidance, you can complete your research work in time with the required standards and expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">We believe in empowering students so, we help, guide, and teach but, not \u2018literally do\u2019 the entire work (the way how the real guide works). Research guidance at SKILLVIRE is unique as per the type of research a student proposes. It can be purely qualitative or purely quantitative. SKILLVIRE team helps in domain selection, research type selection, variable selection, sample selection, topic formulation and, methodology formulation. They train the student in the professional technique of literature review. The team will provide a full document of the research papers having limited access (if needed), tools (if needed), help in calculating the statistics (if needed), and teach how to analyze the qualitative data (if needed). The Student will be taught how to frame the results, discussions, and references as well. Once the research is complete, we help the student to prepare a manuscript from their work that can be submitted in a journal with good indexes and high impact factor, later for their research paper publication (we do not provide service of publishing a research paper). Seats for the research guidance services are limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">SKILLVIRE INTERNSHIP\/TRAINING<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">We believe in helping students to acquire practical skills and real-time work exposure so, interns from psychology and allied disciplines are welcomed to experience and contribute to SKILLVIRE services. We follow the work-from-home model for our organization. There are some general roles &amp; responsibilities (attending team meetings, calculating quantitative data, collecting data, collecting literature, digital paperwork, dissertation template building, finding tools, helping in services optimization &amp; ideas, outreach, website supervision, external monitoring of the social media handles) which are common for the interns at SKILLVIRE. There are also some specific roles and responsibilities (client handling, service content management, movable-immovable graphics planning, policies &amp; ethical planning, event planning &amp; execution) that can be assigned based on the availability &amp; the capability of the interns. You can join anytime throughout the year for up to 100 hours at a time after which, you can reapply as per your requirement. An intern can dedicate either full-time (11 am onwards) or part-time (5 pm onwards) work from home commitment. This organization does not charge any fee or provide salary\/stipend for the internship or training but, the work experience\/training letter\/certificate is chargeable for an intern (covers the letterhead, signature, stamp, and design charges). Experience\/training letter\/certificate for up to the first 100 hours is INR 500. For up to every next 100 hours INR 250 is the charge for the experience\/training letter\/certificate. Single experience letter with more than 100 hours will be charged in similar way. Second letter cannot be issued if the dues are not cleared for the first letter. If by any means, an intern presents irresponsible conduct, misbehaves, abuses, causes harm to any team member, becomes a liability to the organization, stops communicating or does not complete the given tasks, then SKILLVIRE has the authority to end their commitment, deactivate their coupons, and return their dues with a 10% deduction. If an intern causes damage to SKILLVIRE&#8217;s equipment, it is covered from the intern&#8217;s dues. Experience letter is released after all the pending work is completed and submitted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">SKILLVIRE REFUND POLICY<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Live online education: Once registered for an event, payment will only be refunded if the service is canceled by us or not fully delivered.
